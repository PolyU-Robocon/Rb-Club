We are PolyU FENG Robotics Club. PolyU FENG Robotics Club is a club supported by the Faculty of Engineering \(FENG\) and hosted by theIndustrial Centre \(IC\). The aim of the Club is for gathering a group of students, alumni, and friends who are interested at Robotics for sharing information and experience. In particular, the Club would be actively supporting the development of Robots for joining various competitions, including the PolyU teams of ABU Asia-Pacific Robot Contest \(RoboCon\) in every year.

Our Main Focus is ABU Pacific Robocon, an Intra-university robot competition. Winner of the HK division will represent HK to compete with other top-notch universities from different Asian countries.



Being members of the Club, we expect students to be:

1. VERY interested at Robotics and robot development, including all the relevant areas like Machine Learning, Mechanical Design, Embedded Systems, Programming, etc.
2. volunteers for helping the development of robots and supporting PolyU FENG in robotic competitions
3. willing to share knowledge and skill with other members for the advancement of the Club.

**Robotics club juniors are for competition, not for leisure learning.**
